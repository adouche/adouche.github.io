                   The CI pipeline is really cool and convenient because, otherwise, how else would I have noticed that with the new libpcap the Wireshark build started to fail?

                    It started failing with a very strange error message:

                    It says here that CMake generated an incorrect ninja file. Somewhere in the list of dependencies for some target, there is a strange 
                    string - 3 static libraries combined with `;`.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Actually, it's pretty clear that CMake just writes some string there that it got from pkg-config, and something unexpected turned out to be there.

                    The most convoluted explanation that, IMHO, explains nothing.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I understand this as the beginnings of package management in pkg-config - a set of libraries that must be in the system 
                    (because they are needed by dependencies of some .so in the package).
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In the case of static libraries, we get just such strange nonsense, from all the absolute paths combined through “;”.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I didn't bother to investigate who called or understood whom incorrectly because I already have information about transitive dependencies 
                    and don't need it duplicated in .pc files.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    So I just deleted it from all .pc files - 
                    <a href="https://github.com/pg83/ix/commit/bac7f907bc4d8841e4eff9aba93c2a0bd765fc96">https://github.com/pg83/ix/commit/bac7f907bc4d8841e4eff9aba93c2a0bd765fc96</a>.                    
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Generally, I try not to apply such global text replacements on generated files, but sometimes it can’t be avoided, otherwise 
                    static build support would turn into huge patches on top of all known build systems.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Here, for example, is a fix that needs to be applied to all meson.build files - 
                    <a href="https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/die/c/meson.sh#L107-L109">https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/die/c/meson.sh#L107-L109</a>.                
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Unfortunately, in Meson (and CMake, but not in Autoconf!), the author of build scripts can say "build this as .so, even if the package user asked 
                    to build statically" without the ability to override.
