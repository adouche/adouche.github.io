                    Mesa, light of my life, sparks at my fingertips. My sin, my love. Me-sa.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    To build it, the currently very popular build system Meson was developed, and in fact, it's very sad 
                    because Mesa developers know Meson too well and use any of its fucking features.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Actually, Mesa consists of two parts - a plugin loader that implements various state trackers 
                    like OpenGL, Vulkan on top of the plugin interface, and the plugins themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    As the Mesa authors know Meson too well, building Mesa looks something like this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>K object files are compiled;</li>
                <li>N archives are built from them, and it is important to note that there are intersections - the same .o can end up in several archives;</li>
                <li>From these K + N artifacts, M final .so are linked. Also with arbitrary intersections of .a/.o files!</li> 
                </ul>                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    This means that each final artifact contains an arbitrary subset of source files.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    As long as this is linked into .so files with hidden symbols, it's not a problem except for increasing the size of the final code 
                    and compilation time (because some sources are recompiled several times).
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    If we link statically, we encounter understandable problems - repeated symbols during linking.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    When I first built Mesa, I solved this in a very strange way - I dumped all the final artifacts into one bucket 
                    and made one mega-library that replaced all the final artifacts.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Overall, this works pretty well except for one very important scenario - when I need to split this giant artifact 
                    into two parts - loader and drivers - and make them two physically separate dependencies.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    This is necessary to raise the dependency from drivers to end programs, and all intermediate libraries should only depend on the loader. 
                    This is an important requirement if we don't want to rebuild the entire tree of libraries needed to build end GUI programs 
                    for each set of drivers and, in fact, for a normal binary build cache.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I approached the task of splitting about 5 times:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Manually split the final artifact by .o files. Breaks down due to the combinatorial explosion of different ways to build drivers;</li>
                <li>Make everything build into several completely independent .a files - everything was up against the defects of the meson build system 
                    and the peculiarities of the mesa build files - here I tried to manually edit the mesa build scripts (not scalable on updates), 
                    and meson itself (here I was closest to victory, but it didn't work out).</li>
                </ul> 
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    All hope is on <a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc">mrustc</a>, the dude is getting closer and closer to supporting 1.54. 
                    Of course, without a borrow checker, but who needs it outside of development? 
                    He has his own implementation of proc macro (for obvious reasons), which does not require loading .so into the compiler.                
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Right now I've stopped at svg icons with not quite correct rendering because I'm tired of licking Epiphany 
                    (<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web">https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web</a>).
                    I need to see what awaits in building Chromium.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    By the way, I almost defeated tearing in Epiphany. 
                    To do this, I built the webkit web process (which is responsible for rendering) on gtk4, which is better with support for opengl/vulkan canvas, 
                    and the browser itself on gtk3. Because Igalia has already ported WebKIT to gkt4, but the browser itself has not yet. 
                    I think Igalia would be overjoyed to hear that I was doing this.
