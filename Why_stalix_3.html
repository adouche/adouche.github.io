                    Prereq: Part 1, Part 2

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Many times I promised to write about why I created my own Linux distribution and why it is designed this way.

                    Part three: About the package manager design
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    By and large, I had 3 iterations in designing the package manager.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    First iteration
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Packages were Python language descriptions, and a graph executor for each node launched Python, which executed this code. 
                    Homebrew is structured similarly, only using Ruby.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Very quickly I realized that Python is not suitable for this task:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>nodejs rewrites the build system from v8 to autoconf;</li>
                <li>webkit remakes the build system from ANGLE (Google’s implementation of opengl) to CMake;</li>
                <li>chrome vendors a bunch of libraries (I won’t describe them individually);</li>
                <li>telegram vendors all its dependencies and builds them in a way that is not compatible with anything.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I have already written about .wrap files from meson 
                    (there is a whole repository for them - <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/Wrapdb-projects.html">https://mesonbuild.com/Wrapdb-projects.html</a>).
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    This is something to write about endlessly, and here are some very shitty examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>nodejs rewrites the build system from v8 to autoconf;</li>
                <li>webkit remakes the build system from ANGLE (Google’s implementation of opengl) to CMake;</li>
                <li>chrome vendors a bunch of libraries (I won’t describe them individually);</li>
                <li>telegram vendors all its dependencies and builds them in a way that is not compatible with anything.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Fun fact - build systems make life easier for developers, but completely kill the maintainers of this software in the repositories 
                    because de-vendoring all this shit is painful.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I live with this a little easier than any Fedora there. In the case of dynamic linking, vendoring is also path crossing in fs. 
                    In the case of static linking, this is at least not visible to the outside, it is enough to de-vendor all sorts of freetype/fontconfig and so on.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Chrome, by the way, is great in this regard. They help de-vendor those parts that are simply necessary (such as font rendering).
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Among other reasons, it’s painful because every OSS project, from small to large, invents its way of vendoring.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Ideally, it would be very cool if the build systems stopped doing such garbage and agreed with the package systems 
                    on the interaction interface. It's actually not very difficult.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Imagine the command:
                </p>
                <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mix run lib/z lib/freetype bin/make
                bin/cmake bin/clang/14 bin/ninja <span class="nt">--</span> make <span class="nt">-j</span> 16
                </code></pre></div></div>            
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    This command will make #realm, in which the specified libraries, specified build tools, and (here it is important!) wrappers 
                    for the cc/c++/cpp compiler (well, or rustc, whatever) will be available, which will automatically configure the necessary paths 
                    to libraries and header files.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Seems complicated? Well, let's simplify it into alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mixrun=mix run $(cat mix.shell)</code> - 
                    and use it like this:
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mixrun make -j 16</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mixrun --sanitize=address --opt=-O2 make -j 8</code>.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Then in the corresponding makefile, you don’t need to do autodetect at all, list all sorts of -I / -l-L / etc., but just call simple commands like
                    <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc -c x.o x.c</code>.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The same works for cargo and any other build system.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The main point is that the project-level build system should not autodetect the presence of dependencies and deliver them. 
                    Nix can do that, IX can do that.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The problem is that at any given time, it is easier for the author of this or that OSS project to crutch up the next vendoring 
                    instead of negotiating with all interested parties.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Separately, I note that these kludge package managers are completely crap. 
                    I would really like to see how cargo, for example, tries to vendor any lib with settings and data for this lib.
