                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Many times I promised to write about why I created my own Linux distribution and why it is designed this way.

                    Part three: About the package manager design
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    By and large, I had 3 iterations in designing the package manager.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    First iteration
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Packages were Python language descriptions, and a graph executor for each node launched Python, which executed this code. 
                    Homebrew is structured similarly, only using Ruby.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Very quickly I realized that Python is not suitable for this task:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>It is absolutely not composable, you cannot concatenate 2 scripts and get a working script because in Python alignment and indentation are important. 
                    Therefore, the task of "take this script and replace the build phase with this" was completely unworkable.</li>
                <li>The second reason is common for both Ruby and Python, as well as everything except POSIX sh. In these languages, you have to invent some DSL 
                    to describe simple actions that are done with simple commands in shell:</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>os.setcwd('xxx')
                    a = os.environ['yyy'] + '/zzz'
                    os.setcwd(a) <span class="nt">--</span> make <span class="nt">-j</span> 16 
                </code></pre></div></div>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    vs
                </p>
                <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd xxx
                    cd ${yyy}/zzz <span class="nt">--</span> make <span class="nt">-j</span> 16 
                </code></pre></div></div>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In short, this DSL looked crappy, and I definitely didn't want to give it to the user.

                    Arch-style build scripts with meta-information in comments:

                    This was already better, but:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>The task "take this build script and change the build() or dependency list in it a bit" was still not solvable in a reasonable way, 
                    so the bootstrap chain contained a lot of redundant code. For example, I had to copy the build description for building CMake at the earliest 
                    stages when nothing was available yet, or for later stages when the previous CMake and libraries were available.</li>
                <li>I was already starting to get annoyed that I had to repeat the same boilerplate for calling Meson/CMake/etc. 
                    It's worth noting that Arch, for example, can call CMake directly. However, I need to pass 100500 parameters to ensure static build and Nix-style paths 
                    in the file system (in short, DESTDIR and PREFIX are not default).</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    At this point, I discovered Jinja - a language for describing and substituting templates, and the packages began to look like they do now.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pg/ix/tree/main/item/pkgs/bin/kitty">https://git.sr.ht/~pg/ix/tree/main/item/pkgs/bin/kitty</a> - 
                    take a look, there's a template in t/ that specializes the general template for some build system, and two of its inheritors - 
                    linux/, darwin/. Look at them before reading the next points.                
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    It is important to understand that a JSON is built from this template, not a shell script. This JSON contains pieces of shell scripts for different 
                    build phases (build, configure, etc.) and dependency lists.
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Tasks like "do for me the same thing, but with mother-of-pearl buttons" are elegantly solved: expanding and narrowing the list of dependencies, 
                    replacing and making arbitrary modifications to different blocks.</li>
                <li>It becomes possible to pack all the logic related to a particular build system into a template, and make it more and more complex.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Examples:

                    build me Brotli, but with an extended list of libraries because I'm building binaries, not a library.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/stal-ix/ix/blob/main/pkgs/bin/curl/ms/ix.sh">https://github.com/stal-ix/ix/blob/main/pkgs/bin/curl/ms/ix.sh</a> - 
                    build me curl, but with a different http3 library and fresher sources.</li>
                <li><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pg/ix/tree/main/item/pkgs/bin/gdbm/ix.sh">https://git.sr.ht/~pg/ix/tree/main/item/pkgs/bin/gdbm/ix.sh</a> - 
                    build me a binary from libgdbm and add readline to it (note that we are expanding not only the list of libraries, but also the configure flags).</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/die/c/cmake.sh#L43">https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/die/c/cmake.sh#L43</a> - 
                    basic template for CMake, look at how much “squattings” I'm doing there, from passing paths to the compiler to replacing SHARED with STATIC in 
                    CMakeLists.txt - <a href="https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/die/c/cmake.sh#L81">https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/die/c/cmake.sh#L81</a>.</li>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Thanks to this, my build files that the user sees are lean and mean. They only contain information about the essence of things (dependencies), 
                    and all these “squats” are hidden from the user.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    All things are difficult before they are easy, at some point I realized that the templating engine easily solves the task of arbitrarily customizing 
                    the build of a particular target.
