                    I wrote here about how cool it would be to create a realm with one command, in which the specified libraries, 
                    specified build tools and wrappers for the compiler will be available, which will automatically configure the necessary paths to libraries and header files.

                    Previously, to run menuconfig for kernel settings, I would build the kernel through 
                    <a href="https://github.com/stal-ix/ix">IX</a>,                    
                    press ctrl-c, go to the remaining build folder, and there, in the configured environment, run make menuconfig.<br>
                    It was okay for me, but of course, it's embarrassing to give that away to others.

                    I implemented the promised feature of the ability to run a command in an arbitrary realm. It became convenient.

                    These are, of course, quite different things.

                    (By the way, a quick aside: if you have cases where the same elements are repeated in PATH - this means that you do not understand the difference 
                    between these entities, and sometimes the construction of adding something to PATH works twice because it is in the wrong file.)

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The problem here is further exacerbated by the fact that different shells read different startup files depending on the mode.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    For example, bash reads /etc/profile in both interactive and login mode, but most other shells don't!

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In short, here we can clearly see trash, frenzy, and sodomy, a layering of habits, misunderstandings, and so on. Evaluate, for example, /etc/environment -

                    - this is an upyachka born of the fact that sometimes you need to do "login" but without "shell", but variables have to be taken from somewhere!

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Therefore, of course, I intend to do everything "right" (*) in stal/IX, rather than reproduce the hack that everyone is used to!

                    Why?

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Because if I was satisfied with this hack, I would have installed Fedora! And I need better!

                    (*) Right - of course, ssh and the like should start the first shell in login mode. Even better - for each shell, 
                    the user should figure out which files to put their interactive settings (like completion) in and where to put login settings.
