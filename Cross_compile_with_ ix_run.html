                    I wrote here about how cool it would be to create a realm with one command, in which the specified libraries, 
                    specified build tools and wrappers for the compiler will be available, which will automatically configure the necessary paths to libraries and header files.

                    Previously, to run menuconfig for kernel settings, I would build the kernel through 
                    <a href="https://github.com/stal-ix/ix">IX</a>,                    
                    press ctrl-c, go to the remaining build folder, and there, in the configured environment, run make menuconfig.<br>
                    It was okay for me, but of course, it's embarrassing to give that away to others.

                    I implemented the promised feature of the ability to run a command in an arbitrary realm. It became convenient.

                    - cheap auto-build and CI for other platforms. Adding AArch64 to auto-build only took two lines in the build files.<br>

                    - the list of what I regularly build for AArch64 including GDB and even graphical programs!</li>
                <li>New possibilities for bootstrapping. For example, Go is currently not reproducible in terms of classic methods (package managers and build systems), 
                    because the latest version of Go compiled with a C compiler cannot build code for M1 and cannot be compiled on it. 
                    Now I can approach this problem by writing something like this in the Go build file:</li>
                </ul>                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    {% block bld_tool %}
                    bin/qemu(for_target=linux-x86_64)
                    bin/kernel(target=linux-x86_64)

                    {% endblock %}

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Launch QEMU (which I built myself), Linux kernel, Go 1.4 in this build node and run the bootstrap chain there. 
                    And it will work, including under host == darwin.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    It seems to me now that I have achieved something that no one has done before in open source. 
                    All auto-build cross-compiling solutions known to me are based on someone manually preparing pre-built tools, so they have a rather small scope.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Why?

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Because if I was satisfied with this hack, I would have installed Fedora! And I need better!

                    (*) Right - of course, ssh and the like should start the first shell in login mode. Even better - for each shell, 
                    the user should figure out which files to put their interactive settings (like completion) in and where to put login settings.
