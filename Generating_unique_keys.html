                    <h1>Generating stable unique keys</h1>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I solved a long-standing problem - generating unique keys for various programs, but in such a way that they are resistant from generation 
                    to generation, meaning that if the package needs to be rebuilt with the same input data, then the resulting keys should be the same.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                   Usage example:
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    # ix mut system bin/dropbear/runit --seed="dead beef"
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    When installing Dropbear (such an alternative to SSH), it wants to generate host keys that should not change for about the lifetime of the installed system.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    It uses random() for this, which does not correspond to the bright idea of "clean build" - the package is a pure function of its inputs 
                    (as a reminder, this is an important condition for the ability to reuse RO packages between different users (not necessarily even on the same host)).
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Actually, the solution to this problem was divided into two parts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>We load the unwinder from gcc at runtime. No, it doesn't have to be the same unwinder that the rest of the program uses, it can be statically linked
                    <a href="https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/pthread_cancel.c.html#99">https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/pthread_cancel.c.html#99</a>.</li>
                <li>We throw an exception unknown to science 
                    <a href="https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/unwind.c.html#130">https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/unwind.c.html#130</a>.<br>
                    Question for experts  - how does this exception interact with C++ exceptions? And with catch (...)?</li>
                <li>I did not find the code that catches it at the top of the stack, but it used to be quite intricate. Normal people would create one source 
                    file with the extension .cxx and catch it through the usual exception mechanism, but that's not the path of glibc developers.</li>
                </ul>                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    So, if your program carries its own unwind runtime, expect an arbitrary crash as a result of interaction with glibc/pthread_cancel.
