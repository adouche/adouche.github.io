                    I solved a long-standing problem - generating unique keys for various programs, but in such a way that they are resistant from generation 
                    to generation, meaning that if the package needs to be rebuilt with the same input data, then the resulting keys should be the same.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                   Usage example:
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    There is such a function - pthread_cancel().
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Do not use it, anywhere, ever. Its behavior is poorly defined and in real life, it will lead you to some kind of deadlock. 
                    Because you wonâ€™t write tests for this section of code anyway.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    According to the standard, all it should do is call specially registered cleanup handlers and terminate the thread. 
                    But colleagues from glibc decided that this was not enough! And they added the following feature - they call the stack unwinder 
                    to destroy local objects on the stack in this thread.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    How is it done?
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>We load the unwinder from gcc at runtime. No, it doesn't have to be the same unwinder that the rest of the program uses, it can be statically linked
                    <a href="https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/pthread_cancel.c.html#99">https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/pthread_cancel.c.html#99</a>.</li>
                <li>We throw an exception unknown to science 
                    <a href="https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/unwind.c.html#130">https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/unwind.c.html#130</a>.<br>
                    Question for experts  - how does this exception interact with C++ exceptions? And with catch (...)?</li>
                <li>I did not find the code that catches it at the top of the stack, but it used to be quite intricate. Normal people would create one source 
                    file with the extension .cxx and catch it through the usual exception mechanism, but that's not the path of glibc developers.</li>
                </ul>                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    So, if your program carries its own unwind runtime, expect an arbitrary crash as a result of interaction with glibc/pthread_cancel.
