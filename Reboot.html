                    A good, but very long text 
                    <a href="https://keunwoo.com/notes/rebooting/">https://keunwoo.com/notes/rebooting/</a> that contains two simple ideas:

                <li>Rebooting (VM, host, program) is a simple way to return the system from a state with accumulated error to a state without such error.</li>

                    People who know me better know that I like to give a couple of strange architectural tips:
                </p>                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">             
                <ul>
                <li>Periodically restart your programs on the cluster. Usually, updating versions is enough if it is regular.</li>
                <li>A slightly stranger tip - insert abort() into your program in random places. In prod, specifically in prod.</li>               
                </ul>

                    And then, of course, I remembered that Epiphany can work in Flatpak/Snap, which means it can use portals, which means it can call 
                    external programs to view files through the portal.<br>
                    Then my portal opens the app for viewing in a clean environment where there is no corrupted MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE environment variable.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    (Actually, I cut a little bit here, and the path to the portal is not exactly like that, but it would complicate the narrative and not give more understanding.)
