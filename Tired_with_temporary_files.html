                    <h1>Tired with <del>all these</del> temporary files</h1>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Today I have a joke for you about my sense of beauty.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                   Personally, I hate programs that want to create temporary files. In general, "temporary file" is some nonsense, because why write ephemeral data to a persistent file?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Data can be buffered in memory or written through a pipe to another program’s input, or something similarly reasonable.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Usually, programs write something to temporary files as a hack, when some block of code already accepts int fd, and rewriting it to a normal 
                    interface is too lazy, or when some program in the chain does not know how to pipe.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    In the first case, by the way, in modern Linux you can use memfd_create(), which is quite useful in terms of "sweeping garbage under the bed".
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Another problem with temporary files is that various strange programs do not respect the TMPDIR setting and try to write directly to /tmp. 
                    Moreover, they come up with some wild ways of access differentiation and "non-intersection" with other instances.

                    How many different ways of “uniqueness” did you count here?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I repeat, this infuriates me greatly, and I have set a goal for myself - all the programs that I use should be able to use TMPDIR.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    By the way, a little off topic, TMPDIR should of course be a "complex" path, including user ID and session ID (for example, to effectively clean up 
                    this junk at the end of the session):
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    pg->echo ${TMPDIR}
                    /var/tmp/10000/10953
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    That’s why I don’t have a root /tmp folder in <a href="https://github.com/stal-ix">stal/IX</a>.  
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Why?
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Because, by a strange coincidence, all programs that have their own strong opinions about the naming of the folder with temporary files try to write to /tmp.<br>
                    And I don’t have it, but I have /var/tmp with session separation.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    So all such programs break, and I fix them all.<br>
                    To make this process less painful, I created a small library for it -

                    Its application is almost automated -
