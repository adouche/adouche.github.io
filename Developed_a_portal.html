                    Another two vulnerabilities that I consider unimportant. And some thoughts on their implementation:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/set/ci/unwrap/ix.sh">https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/set/ci/unwrap/ix.sh</a> 
                    - cheap auto-build and CI for other platforms. Adding AArch64 to auto-build only took two lines in the build files.<br>
                    <a href="https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/set/ci/unwrap/linux/aarch64/ix.sh">https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/set/ci/unwrap/linux/aarch64/ix.sh</a> 
                    - the list of what I regularly build for AArch64 including GDB and even graphical programs!</li>
                <li>New possibilities for bootstrapping. For example, Go is currently not reproducible in terms of classic methods (package managers and build systems), 
                    because the latest version of Go compiled with a C compiler cannot build code for M1 and cannot be compiled on it. 
                    Now I can approach this problem by writing something like this in the Go build file:</li>
                </ul>                
                <ol>
                <li>Complex security models do not "compose" well, and end up being poorly interacting. Like selinux + cgroups;</li>
                <li>The more complex the system, the harder it is to think about it for a leatherbag.</li>
                </ol>                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Therefore, I believe that "all-or-nothing" type models rule due to their simplicity - it is harder to mess up in their implementation, 
                    and they are easier to think about. And despite the fact that they cannot express various crap complex policies, they turn out to be safer.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    How to deal with inherent complexity? I believe that through hierarchy - the top level is divided into two "all/nothing" layers. 
                    Within each layer you can run a container with the same simple division.
